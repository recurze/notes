* "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher
  a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts,
  build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders,
  cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure,
  program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.
  Specialization is for insects." - Robert Anson Heinlein

* Four levels of decision making:
    - Consensus: everyone agrees; most time consuming.
    - Vote: have 2 or more appealing options, majority wins
    - Consult: get everyone's input but you decide
    - Dictate: you decide, no external input; fastest.
* Four agreements:
    - Be impeccable with your word.
    - Don't take anything personally.
    - Don't make assumptions.
    - Always do your best.

* Engine vs Power ups:
    - "Engine" is the core, broadly useful things you need to learn that will
      help you now and in the long term (math, foreign lang, writing, CS)
    - Keep in mind, this is more of a spectrum than a dichotomy.
    - Spend most of the time on Engine, but when you get an opportunity go
      all-in on powerups.

* Brainstorming is based on 4 rules:
    - generate as many ideas as possible
    - prioritize unusual or original idea
    - combine and refine ideas generated
    - abstain from criticism during the exercise

    - mere presence of others acts as a motivating factor
    - quantity evetually leads to quality
* Why brainstorming doesn't work:
    - social loafing: ppl put less effort when working in a team than alone
    - social anxiety
    - regression to the mean: downward adjustment whereby the most talented
      member end up matching the performance of the less talented counterpart
      (Does this happen?)
    - Production blocking: No matter the size of the group, individuals can only
      express a single idea at a time for the other group memembers to hear them
      Ideas per person decreases with group size.
* Why then is brainstorming used:
    - with increased specialization of labor, and that problem-solving benefits
      from different types of knowledge, the right combination would
      theoretically would increase the expertise in the room.
    - More democratic
    - Intuitively the right thing to do, even though the absence of evidence

* Just ask them individually first, then meet as a group and everyone goes over
  all the ideas. Echoed by most commenters (and readers)
* Anonymous brainstorming also helps with the anxiety issue.

* on the subject of forgiveness and revenge
    - While doesn't have place for revenge in a civilized society and rightly
      so, the need for revenge/retribution is quite innate. It is healthy to
      forgive but it's quite difficult.
    - Suggests we forgive others when it longer makes sense to hold a grudge.
    - It often gives no benefit to not move on from the wrong that was visited
      upon us.
    - INTERESTING: Couldn’t it have a function of regulating social behavior
      such that by holding a grudge society is helped if this causes the perp
      to at least be aware of impropriety of their transgression?
    - In a repeating game, revenge can be a useful tool to signal to the other
      party that their actions were not acceptable and to impose cost on present
      and future actions of the same type.
    - "To forgive and forget means to throw away dearly bought experience.” - Schopenhauer
